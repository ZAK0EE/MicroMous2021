- This was an ambitious project (MicroMouse) to join the national competition for micromouse during my participation in Squad X team.

- What's presented here is the software parts that works and tested using [mackorone](https://github.com/mackorone/mms) simulator.
The software algorithm used is [modified flood fill algorithm](http://ijcte.org/papers/738-T012.pdf)
